# VueJS TypeScript Cypress Boilerplate 🚀🔬

A ready-to-use boilerplate for VueJS applications written in TypeScript with Cypress for testing.

## Project setup

🔧 Run the following command to install all the project dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

## Compiles and hot-reloads for development

🚀 Run the following command to compile and hot-reload the application for development:

```shell
npm run serve
```

This command starts a development server and updates the application in real-time whenever a change is made to the source code.

## Compiles and minifies for production

👉 Run the following command to compile and minify the application for production:

```shell
npm run build
```

This command generates an optimized production-ready build that can be deployed to a web server.

## Run your unit tests

🔬 Run the following command to execute the unit tests for the application using Cypress:

```shell
npm run test:unit
```

Unit tests are used to test individual components and functions in isolation.

## Run your end-to-end tests

🌐 Run the following command to execute the end-to-end tests for the application using Cypress:

```
npm run test:e2e
```

End-to-end tests simulate user interactions and test the application as a whole.

## Lints and fixes files

✨ Run the following command to lint and fix the source code files:

```
npm run lint
```

Linting helps identify and fix common coding mistakes and enforces code style conventions.
